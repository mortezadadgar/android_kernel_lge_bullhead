config CHROMEOS
	bool
	depends on ARM_CHROMEOS_FIRMWARE || (NVRAM && ACPI_CHROMEOS)

	---help---
	  Provides abstracted interfaces to the firmware features provided on
	  ChromeOS devices. It depends on a lowlevel driver to implement the
	  firmware interface on the platform.

config CHROMEOS_VBC_BLK
	bool
	depends on CHROMEOS

	---help---
	  Provides access to vboot context stored on block device.  Select this
	  if you have a ChromeOS firmware that does not support storing vboot
	  context in EC's nvram.

config CHROMEOS_VBC_EC
	bool
	depends on CHROMEOS && MFD_CROS_EC

	---help---
	  Provides access to vboot context stored on EC's nvram.  Select this
	  if you have a ChromeOS firmware that supports storing vboot context
	  in EC's nvram.

config CHROMEOS_RAMOOPS_RAM_START
        hex "Physical address of preserved RAM"
	depends on PSTORE_RAM && CHROMEOS
        default "0"

        ---help---
          Address of the memory area that is used for logging using ramoops.
	  This value can also be set through platform data.

          For this feature to be useful, the selected memory area must be
          preserved across reboot, so not used by the boot loader, for example.

config CHROMEOS_RAMOOPS_RAM_SIZE
        hex "Size of preserved RAM"
	depends on PSTORE_RAM && CHROMEOS
        default "0"

        ---help---
          Size of the memory area that is used for logging using ramoops.
	  This value can also be set through platform data.

          For this feature to be useful, the selected memory area must be
          preserved across reboot, so not used by the boot loader, for example.

config CHROMEOS_RAMOOPS_RECORD_SIZE
        hex "Size of a single dump logged in RAM"
	depends on PSTORE_RAM && CHROMEOS
        default "0x00001000"

        ---help---
          This is the size of a single dump which is logged in RAM. Should be
	  set according to the level of detail needed in the dump.
	  This value can also be set through platform data.

	  Must be divisible by CHROMEOS_RAMOOPS_RAM_SIZE.

config CHROMEOS_RAMOOPS_DUMP_OOPS
        hex "Flag to dump oopses and panics or only panics"
	depends on PSTORE_RAM && CHROMEOS
        default "1"

        ---help---
	  If flag is set to 0 dump oopses and panics.
	  If flag is set to 1 dump only panics.

	  This value can also be set through platform data.
          For this feature to be useful, the selected memory area must be
          preserved across reboot, so not used by the boot loader, for example.
