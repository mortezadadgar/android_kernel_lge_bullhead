	help
	  This driver is for the EMIF module available in Texas Instruments
	  SoCs. EMIF is an SDRAM controller that, based on its revision,
	  supports one or more of DDR2, DDR3, and LPDDR2 SDRAM protocols.
	  This driver takes care of only LPDDR2 memories presently. The
	  functions of the driver includes re-configuring AC timing
	  parameters and other settings during frequency, voltage and
	  temperature changes
