* ams AS3722 Power management IC.

Required properties:
-------------------
- compatible: Must be "ams,as3722".
- reg: I2C device address.
- interrupt-controller: AS3722 has internal interrupt controller which takes the
  interrupt request from  internal sub-blocks like RTC, regulators, GPIOs as well
  as external input.
- #interrupt-cells: Should be set to 2 for IRQ number and flags.
  The first cell is the IRQ number.
  The second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from binding document
	interrupts.txt, using dt-bindings/irq.

Optional submodule and their properties:
---------------------------------------

Pinmux and GPIO:
---------------
Device has 8 GPIO pins which can be configured as GPIO as well as the special IO
functions.

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

Following are properties which is needed if GPIO and pinmux functionality
is required:
- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
- #gpio-cells: Number of GPIO cells. Refer to binding document gpio/gpio.txt
- pinctrl-names: A pinctrl state named "default" must be defined, using the
		bindings in pinctrl/pinctrl-binding.txt.
- pinctrl[0...n]: Nodes for pin control to represents state 0 to state n.
	Each of these nodes contains different subnodes to represents
	some desired configuration for a list of pins. This configuration can
	include the mux function to select on those pin(s), and various pin
	configuration parameters, such as pull-up, open drain.

Each subnode have following properties:
Required properties:
	pins: List of pins. Valid options for pins properties are
		gpio0, gpio1, gpio2, gpio3, gpio4, gpio5, gpio6, gpio7

Optional properties:
	Optional properties are
		function, bias-disable, bias-pull-up, bias-pull-down,
		bias-high-impedance, drive-open-drain, low-power-enable

		Valid options for funtion properties are:
		gpio, interrupt-out, gpio-in-interrupt,
		vsup-vbat-low-undebounce-out, vsup-vbat-low-debounce-out,
		voltage-in-standby, oc-pg-sd0, oc-pg-sd6, powergood-out,
		pwm-in, pwm-out, clk32k-out, watchdog-in, soft-reset-in

Regulators:
-----------
Device has multiple DCDC and LDOs. The node "regulators" is require if regulator
functionality is needed.

Following are properties of regulator subnode.

Optional properties:
-------------------
The input supply of regulators are the optional properties on the
regulator node. The input supply of these regulators are provided
through following properties:
vsup-sd2-supply: Input supply for SD2.
vsup-sd3-supply: Input supply for SD3.
vsup-sd4-supply: Input supply for SD4.
vsup-sd5-supply: Input supply for SD5.
vin-ldo0-supply: Input supply for LDO0.
vin-ldo1-6-supply: Input supply for LDO1 and LDO6.
vin-ldo2-5-7-supply: Input supply for LDO2, LDO5 and LDO7.
vin-ldo3-4-supply: Input supply for LDO3 and LDO4.
vin-ldo9-10-supply: Input supply for LDO9 and LDO10.
vin-ldo11-supply: Input supply for LDO11.

Optional sub nodes:
-----------------
	The subnodes name is the name of regulator and it must be one of:
	sd[0-6], ldo[0-7], ldo[9-11]

	Each sub-node should contain the constraints and initialization
	information for that regulator. See regulator.txt for a description
	of standard properties for these sub-nodes.
	Additional custom properties  are listed below.
		ams,ext-control: External control of the rail. The option of
			this properties will tell which external input is
			controlling this rail. Valid values are 0, 1, 2 ad 3.
			0: There is no external control of this rail.
			1: Rail is controlled by ENABLE1 input pin.
			2: Rail is controlled by ENABLE2 input pin.
			3: Rail is controlled by ENABLE3 input pin.
		ams,enable-tracking: Enable tracking with SD1, only supported
			by LDO3.

Clock:
======
AS3722 supports one 32KHz clock to output from device. The clock control is
provided through the clock driver.
This binding uses the common clock binding ./clock-bindings.txt.
The device node should have the optional properties to support the clock:
#clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 1. The clock id for
	single clock output is 0.

Power-off:
=========

AS3722 supports the system power off by turning off all its rail. The power off
is provided through pm power off.
The device node should have the following properties to enable power-off
functionality from ams AS3722:
ams,system-power-controller: To enable the power off functionality through
	device.
