Qualcomm GPU

Qualcomm Adreno GPU

Required properties:
- label:		A string used as a descriptive name for the device.
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,kgsl-3d0" and "qcom,kgsl-3d"
- reg:			Specifies the register base address and size. The second interval
			specifies the shader memory base address and size.
- reg-names:		Resource names used for the physical address of device registers
			and shader memory. "kgsl_3d0_reg_memory" gives the physical address
			and length of device registers while "kgsl_3d0_shader_memory" gives
			physical address and length of device shader memory.
- interrupts:		Interrupt mapping for GPU IRQ.
- interrupt-names:	String property to describe the name of the interrupt.
- qcom,id:		An integer used as an identification number for the device.

- qcom,clk-map:		A bit map value for clocks controlled by kgsl.
				KGSL_CLK_SRC    0x00000001
				KGSL_CLK_CORE   0x00000002
				KGSL_CLK_IFACE  0x00000004
				KGSL_CLK_MEM    0x00000008
				KGSL_CLK_MEM_IFACE 0x00000010
				KGSL_CLK_AXI    0x00000020
				KGSL_CLK_RBBMTIMER 0x00000080

- clocks:		List of phandle and clock specifier pairs, one pair
			for each clock input to the device.
- clock-names:		List of clock input name strings sorted in the same
			order as the clocks property.
				Current values of clock-names are:
				"src_clk", "core_clk", "iface_clk", "mem_clk", "mem_iface_clk",
				"alt_mem_iface_clk", "rbbmtimer_clk"
				"core_clk" and "iface_clk" are required and others are optional

Bus Scaling Data:
- qcom,msm-bus,name: String property to describe the name of the 3D graphics processor.
- qcom,msm-bus,num-cases: This is the the number of Bus Scaling use cases defined in the vectors property.
- qcom,msm-bus,active-only: A boolean flag indicating if it is active only.
- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths: This represents the number of paths in each Bus Scaling Usecase.
- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps: A series of 4 cell properties, format of which is:
						<src dst ab ib>, <src dst ab ib>, // For Bus Scaling Usecase 1
						<src dst ab ib>, <src dst ab ib>, // For Bus Scaling Usecase 2
						<..  ..  .. ..>, <..  ..  .. ..>; // For Bus Scaling Usecase n
						This property is a series of all vectors for all Bus Scaling Usecases.
						Each set of vectors for each usecase describes bandwidth votes for a combination
						of src/dst ports.  The driver will set the desired use case based on the selected
						power level and the desired bandwidth vote will be registered for the port pairs.
					Current values of src are:
						0 = MSM_BUS_MASTER_GRAPHICS_3D
						1 = MSM_BUS_MASTER_GRAPHICS_3D_PORT1
						2 = MSM_BUS_MASTER_V_OCMEM_GFX3D
					Current values of dst are:
						0 = MSM_BUS_SLAVE_EBI_CH0
						1 = MSM_BUS_SLAVE_OCMEM
					ab: Represents aggregated bandwidth. This value is 0 for Graphics.
					ib: Represents instantaneous bandwidth. This value has a range <0 8000 MB/s>

- qcom,ocmem-bus-client: Container for another set of bus scaling properties
						qcom,msm-bus,name
						qcom,msm-bus,num-cases
						qcom,msm-bus,num-paths
						qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps
			to be used by ocmem msm bus scaling client.

GDSC Oxili Regulators:
- vddcx-supply:			Phandle for vddcx regulator device node.
- vdd-supply:			Phandle for vdd regulator device node.

IOMMU Data:
- iommu:			Phandle for the KGSL IOMMU device node

GPU Power levels:
- qcom,gpu-pwrlevels:		Container for the GPU Power Levels (see
				adreno-pwrlevels.txt)

DCVS Core info
- qcom,dcvs-core-info		Container for the DCVS core info (see
				dcvs-core-info.txt)

Optional Properties:
- qcom,initial-powerlevel: This value indicates which qcom,gpu-pwrlevel should be used at start time
			   and when coming back out of resume
- qcom,bus-control:	   Boolean. Enables an independent bus vote from the gpu frequency
- qcom,bus-width:	   Bus width in number of bytes. This enables dynamic AB bus voting based on
			   bus width and actual bus transactions.
- qcom,gpubw-dev:	   a phandle to a device representing bus bandwidth requirements
			   (see devdw.txt)
- qcom,idle-timeout:	   This property represents the time in milliseconds for idle timeout.
- qcom,chipid:		   If it exists this property is used to replace
			   the chip identification read from the GPU hardware.
			   This is used to override faulty hardware readings.
- qcom,strtstp-sleepwake:  Boolean. Enables use of GPU SLUMBER instead of SLEEP for power savings

- qcom,pm-qos-active-latency:
				Right after GPU wakes up from sleep, driver votes for
				acceptable maximum latency to the pm-qos driver. This
				voting demands that the system can not go into any
				power save state *if* the latency to bring system back
				into active state is more than this value.
				Value is in microseconds.
- qcom,pm-qos-wakeup-latency:
				Similar to the above. Driver votes against deep low
				power modes right before GPU wakes up from sleep.

The following properties are optional as collecting data via coresight might
not be supported for every chipset. The documentation for coresight
properties can be found in:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/coresight/coresight.txt

- coresight-id           Unique integer identifier for the bus.
- coresight-name         Unique descriptive name of the bus.
- coresight-nr-inports   Number of input ports on the bus.
- coresight-outports     List of output port numbers on the bus.
- coresight-child-list   List of phandles pointing to the children of this
                         component.
- coresight-child-ports  List of input port numbers of the children.
