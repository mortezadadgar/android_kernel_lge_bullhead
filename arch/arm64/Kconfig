	  Kuser_Helpers is a set of functions in the vector page at a fixed address that
	  are used to support applications compiled for legacy ARM <7.  These functions
	  being at a fixed address creates an ASLR bypass.

	  Do not enable this feature unless you know what you are doing, this is
	  experimental, and will break any application that uses the Kuser_Helpers or
	  registers a signal handler and uses the kernel trampolines.

	  If unsure, say N.
